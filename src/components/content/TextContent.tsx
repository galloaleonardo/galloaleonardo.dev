                About {Number(new Date().getFullYear()) - 2016} years ago I started my journey with the good old Delphi/Pascal developing desktop applications for ERP systems.
                Later, I built robust applications with PHP, Vue.js, SQL Server and realized that web development would be my focus where I would demand time and dedication.
                Today, although I like front-end, I focus on back-end development with Typescript and NodeJS. Even though I focus on specific technologies, I have a generalist view from the development point, where I have studied and implemented small projects in GoLang and Python.
                I've had experience in many different projects, from conventional applications like REST APIs to serverless applications like AWS Lambda. I've used some relational databases (like MySQL, SQL Server, AWS Aurora) and non-relational databases (like MongoDB and AWS DynamoDB).
                The cloud service present in my day-to-day life is Amazon AWS. In general, after a while of experience, I can identify the type of service that can solve my problem, but I recognize that I still have a lot to learn. Besides infrastructure, I take some risks with Infrastructure as a Code like Terraform.
                I am aware that the day to day life of a software engineer is not only about code. You have to communicate with excellence, give visibility to your work and treat the people around you well. Feedbacks should be part of the whole process.
                Speaking of communication, I speak Portuguese (BR) natively and have a good level of English to the point that I can communicate in a non-confusing way.
